My name is Walid Ahmed Dhafer Al-Asmari. I am 26 years old. I recently moved to Riyadh. I graduated from Umm Al-Qura University, specializing in information science in the College of Computers and Information Systems. I was trained at King Abdulaziz Hospital in archiving files and documents. I was employed at the Creative Company in Riyadh as the company’s supervisor, assistant director, and company supervisor.
